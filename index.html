                    <p>My life experiences have formed the path to me becoming a psychotherapist. Coming from a large family with many challenges, I became interested in the different personalities and behaviours.</p>
                    <p>From an early age I had a need to understand myself and those around me. As a Montessori teacher, I was drawn to how children were affected or impacted both by everyday and more traumatic events in their lives. It encouraged me to reflect on my own upbringing and how my past might be entangled in my life as an adult.</p>
                    <p>My interest continued through parenting and the responsibility of being a mother and all that was involved in that role.</p>
                    <p>Having moved many times in my life to many different countries, it has helped me to understand the human need to feel connected and what it can feel like to be an outsider. My experience in therapy was so rewarding and had such a positive impact on how I live my life, I decided to pursue as a career to help others.</p>
                    <p>In 2016 I qualified from CIT with a BA (Hons) Degree in Counselling & Psychotherapy. As an accredited member of the IACP I practice under a strict “Code of Ethics”.</p>
                    <p>Other relevant qualifications which I feel compliment/enhance my practice are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Diploma in “Svastha” Yoga Teaching (Singapore).</li>
                        <li>Reiki: Level 1 and 2 (Singapore).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I was a volunteer Counsellor with ARC House for over 2 years and found this work very rewarding.</p>
                    <p>Since qualifying I have been working on building a private practice and continue to keep my training up to date by attending relevant seminars and workshops.</p>

                    <p>People come to therapy for all sorts of reasons.</p>
                    <p>We all go through times when we feel the need for some extra support or help, dealing with issues that are causing us stress or worry. Making the initial contact can be the hardest part, talking to a stranger about what is concerning you is not easy.</p>
                    <p>With that in mind my aim is to make the space as safe and supportive as I can.</p>
                    <p>Counselling involves looking at what is not working for you and exploring how this might be changed using different strategies, helping you to regain a feeling of control over the issues rather than the other way around.</p>
                    <p>Psychotherapy delves a bit deeper into understanding why we respond the way we do to certain triggers. Some childhood experiences or traumatic events can leave lasting effects on us resulting in ways of interacting/being that are not helpful to us.</p>
                    <p>When we are not given the space/protection in childhood to become or appreciate our true selves, aspects of us can end up hidden or hinder our personal growth. Psychotherapy helps us unravel the past and live in a more present freer way.</p>
                    <p>As an Integrative Humanistic Therapist, I draw on a number of methodologies in my work with clients, including Gestalt, Transactional Analysis, Person Centred, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Internal Family Systems. I believe attachment can be a very helpful lens through which to gain understanding of ourselves. Mindfulness is an important tool for developing self awareness and promoting regulation.</p>

                    <p>Every client has different goals for therapy, this can be decided on collaboratively. At all times I do my utmost to work within the boundaries as set out by the client.</p>
                    <p>Sessions last one hour and are usually weekly/fortnightly, this can vary depending on the clients individual needs.</p>
                    <p>My fee is €60.00 per hour (accepting Paypal/Revolut).</p>
                    <p>Currently, under covid-19 restrictions, sessions are online via Zoom or FaceTime.</p>
